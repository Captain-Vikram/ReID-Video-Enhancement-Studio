# This file ensures the models directory is tracked in Git
# 
# The models directory contains AI model files that are typically:
# - Too large for Git (excluded in .gitignore)  
# - Downloaded separately or trained by users
# - Essential for the application structure
#
# Place your model files here:
# - best.pt (YOLO model for person detection)
# - custom_model.pt (your trained models)
# - *.onnx (ONNX format models)
# - *.h5 (Keras/TensorFlow models)
#
# Note: Large model files should be stored using Git LFS
# or downloaded via setup scripts
